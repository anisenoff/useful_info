# NSF GRFP

I really didn't want to apply for the grant. My advisor had mentioned it early in the summer and I had made the conscious decision not to apply since it was due a little less than a week after a big paper deadline. Long story short my advisor realized I wasn't applying and then made it so my best option was to apply (read: I was really worried about asking for letters of rec with such little lead time and he offered/threatened to ask people about letters of rec if I didn't do it myself). My undergrad advisor (Blase Ur) is one of the absolute best people I know and I owe him so much for pushing me out of my comfort zone.

I ended up writing and rewriting my entire application in less than a week. I do not recommend doing that, it was very stressful. 


Personal Advice
* Think about a bigger important problem that you want to solve. Not just one small project
* If your project is related to other work you are doing that can be helpful, but only if you actually care about the topic
* Don't forget about explaining how you are gonna evaluate your research proposal (I didn't and people mentioned it)
* Test that you can upload stuff early. I know some people that didn't test that they could upload stuff and got screwed over by the formatting requirements.
* From my reviews I think the recommendations really made a big difference for me
* The best part of having the application done early is that I was able to reuse a ton of the text from my personal statement and diversity statements. Basically, my intro and “intellectual merit” sections became my SoP and my broader impacts section became my diversity statement

* Links to a huge number of applications from people in a huge number of fields and different years
    * Also includes feedback 
    * Make sure you pay attention to what year people are (I read some from 2nd years and was totally convinced that I wouldn't get the award)
* This includes a lot of good advice but I think a bit of it might be a tad out of date at this point
